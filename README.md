## General Boolean Function Benchmark Suite 

This repository contains the presentation material of our recently published General Boolean Function Benchmark Suite (GBFS). GBFS provides a benchmark that can be used to evaluate the search performance and robustness of heuristic methods in logic synthesis. The corresponding paper has been presented at the 17th ACM/SIGEVO Conference on Foundations of Genetic Algorithms (FOGA'23) last year.

The paper has been presented as a poster at the 17th ACM/SIGEVO Conference on Foundations of Genetic Algorithms (FOGA'23). 
The slides have been used for a talk given at the Chair of Artificial Intelligence Methodology of the RWTH Aachen University in Germany.
