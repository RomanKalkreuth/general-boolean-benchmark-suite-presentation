## General Boolean Function Benchmark Suite 

This repository contains the slides that present our recently published General Boolean Function Benchmark Suite (GBFB) for Genetic Programming (GP). GBFB is a benchmark suite that
can be used to evaluate the performance and robustness of GP systems in logic synthesis.
